<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hot Body Buddy helps you get in the habit of going to the gym. It displays how many times you went to the gym, your goal, motivational quotes and loading images. You can also store your customised workout routines and gym performance so you can compare with your previous records after the workout.
